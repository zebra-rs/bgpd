# Dynamic Neighbors

BGP dynamic neighbors, also known as BGP peer groups, allow you to simplify the
configuration and management of a large number of BGP peers. Instead of
configuring individual neighbors with their respective IP addresses, you can
define a peer group with a set of common attributes and policies. Any new
neighbor that matches the defined criteria will automatically inherit the
group's configuration.
